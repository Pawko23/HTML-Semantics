# HTML-Semantics
## Overview
Hi! This repository contains a collection of HTML files that I am working on to improve my understanding and implementation of semantic HTML. The purpose of this project is to practise and demonstrate best HTML practises, with a strong focus on accessibility and semantic correctness, following WCAG 2.1 guidelines and ARIA's set of attributes.

## Structure
The repository includes `to-recreate` folder with five HTML files that I will transform to best semantics possible:
* blog.html
* about.html
* article.html
* ecommerce.html
* portfolio.html

## Purpose
1. Learn best HTML practises - Understanding the importance and applying semantic tags, attributes, etc.
2. Enhance Accessibility - Many users rely on assistive technologies. Writing semantic HTML makes web content accessible for all of us, including those with disabilities.
3. Improve Code Readability and Maintainability - Semantic HTML provides clearer context and meaning to the content, making it easier for developers to understand and maintain the code.

## How to use
Since semantic HTML is the main focus in this project, pages are not really visual-friendly but feel free to explore the files in `to-recreate` directory and compare differences in commits for each of them to see how I have transformed non-semantic code into semantic HTML.
